## 🎯My Approach: 
- Before simulation, each module is designed conceptually using hand-drawn block diagrams and written reasoning to validate the logic flow through mental simulation and small example cases.
- The block diagram is then refined into a rough structural, gate-level representation before being implemented, debugged, and rigorously tested in digital logic simulators such as Logisim Evolution and Falstad.
- Where possible, I explore multiple design approaches to achieve the same functionality, comparing behavior, complexity, and design trade-offs before finalizing an implementation.

## 📂 Project Structure  
Each module will have its own folder containing:  
- A dedicated **README.md** explaining design, features, and usage  
- **Images** of schematics, simulations, and hardware builds  

## 🎯 Goals  
- Understand computation from the ground up  
- Document the full design and build process  
- Share schematics, notes, and experiments for others to learn from
